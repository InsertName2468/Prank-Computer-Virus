# Prank-Computer-Virus
A simple, fake computer virus I created using Python, used to prank others and it does no harm to computer.

# How to use?
Simply download the source code as zip file and run the VIRUS.py or clone this repository. Make sure you have installed the latest version of Python because I write this code using Python 3.11 and it might not work on older versions of Python. Also, you need to make sure that your "victim's" computer has Python Turtle Graphics, if not it won't work.
